    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>You are going about your business one day, sitting on the couch playing video games, when a terrible feeling overcomes you.</p>

    <p><em>"I'm hungry... I'm angry... I'm HANGRY!!!"</em>, you growl.</p>

    <p>You look around, but can't find any satisfactory snacks. Just when you are ready to resign yourself to your fate, a magical imp appears.</p>

    <p><em>"Ooh hoo hoo hoo! What's this I see? Are you looking for a snack? Answer my riddles, and you'll get what you seek!"</em> cackles the imp, while hopping around in some sort of annoying dance.</p>

    <p>You think to yourself why you have to go through all this trouble, but that you don't really have anything else to do anyway, so why not?</p>
