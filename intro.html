    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>Hello, welcome to your Christmas Scavenger hunt. I have hidden clues around the house that once solved, contain the code to open the lock on your present.</p>

    <p><em>You're probably thinking, well I can just the string around this </em>, but I spent a long time coding this so you better not.</p>

    <p><em>You may ask for help one time if you need to.</em> If you dont know an answer, well then Christmas is ruined.</p>

    <p>You think to yourself why you have to go through all this trouble, but that you don't really have anything else to do anyway, so why not?</p>

    <p>Time to get up and hunt. Best of luck.*Insert evil laugh*</p>
